# Study Buddies – Sprint 1

## Project Overview
Study Buddies is a web application designed to help university students find peers to study with. Students can create profiles, list the subjects they are studying, and connect with other students who share similar academic interests. The aim of the application is to support collaborative learning, improve academic outcomes, and reduce isolation among students.

This repository contains the **Sprint 1 (Proposal and Setup)** work for the Software Engineering module.
