# Study Buddies - Sprint 1

## Project Overview

Study Buddies is a web service meant to help university students locate people to study with. Students can connect with other students who have similar academic interests, establish profiles, and identify the subjects they are studying. The application's goals are to lessen student isolation, enhance academic performance, and encourage collaborative learning.

The Software Engineering module's Sprint 1 (Proposal and Setup) work is contained in this repository.

## Running the Project Using Docker

To run the project locally using Docker:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   cd study-buddies

3. Start the development environment:
   docker compose up --build

4. Open a browser and go to:
   http://localhost:300

If it is functioning, we can certainly see:

Study Buddies is running!

## Agile Project Management

During Sprint 1, agile methods are used. For managing work and monitor progress, the team makes best use of a GitHub Project Kanban board.

The following columns are part of the Kanban board:
- Backlog
- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

Throughout the sprint, Sprint 1 tasks like documentation, Docker settings, repository setup, and planning activities are monitored and updated.

## Sprint 1 Documentation

All Sprint 1 documentation is maintained in the docs/ folder in this repository:
- Code of Conduct
- Team Roles
- Personas
- Ethical Issues
- Meeting Notes

These documents are combined into a single PDF for Sprint 1 submission.

## Sprint 1 Status
At the conclusion of the first sprint, the project has succeeded in:
- A working atmosphere where everyone in the group can work and grow
- A well-defined project scope and target users
- Mutually agreed roles and guidelines for the team
- Evaluating ethical and user-centred issues
- Ability to go on to Sprint 2
