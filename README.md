# Study Buddies – Sprint 1

## Project Overview
Study Buddies is a web application designed to help university students find peers to study with. Students can create profiles, list the subjects they are studying, and connect with other students who share similar academic interests. The aim of the application is to support collaborative learning, improve academic outcomes, and reduce isolation among students.

This repository contains the **Sprint 1 (Proposal and Setup)** work for the Software Engineering module.

## Agile Project Management

Agile practices are followed during Sprint 1. The team uses a GitHub Project Kanban board to manage tasks and track progress.

The Kanban board includes the following columns:
- Backlog
- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

Sprint 1 tasks such as repository setup, Docker configuration, documentation, and planning activities are tracked and updated throughout the sprint.

## Sprint 1 Documentation

All Sprint 1 documentation is maintained in the docs/ folder in this repository:
- Code of Conduct
- Team Roles
- Personas
- Ethical Issues
- Meeting Notes

These documents are combined into a single PDF for Sprint 1 submission.

## Sprint 1 Status
By the end of Sprint 1, the project has achieved:
- A working development environment for all group members
- A clearly defined project scope and target users
- Agreed team roles and working practices
- Consideration of ethical and user-centred issues
- Readiness to progress into Sprint 2 (requirements and design)
